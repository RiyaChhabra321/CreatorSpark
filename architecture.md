# High-Level Architecture

CreatorSpark follows a modular, human-centric architecture:

1. Input Layer  
Creators provide their social media handle or past content data.

2. Analysis Layer  
The system analyzes engagement patterns, posting time, caption length, and tone from previous content.

3. Generative AI Layer  
AI models generate personalized reel ideas, scripts, captions, and insights based on the analyzed data.

4. Interaction Layer  
An AI chat assistant allows creators to ask questions and improve future content using insights.

This architecture is designed to be scalable with future integration of official social media APIs.
