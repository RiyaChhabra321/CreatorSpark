# CreatorSpark

CreatorSpark is a Generative AI–powered, human-centric content intelligence platform designed to help social media creators generate personalized content and gain clarity on what works for them.

## Problem
Content creators often face burnout due to repetitive ideation, generic AI suggestions, and a lack of understanding of why certain posts perform better than others. Existing tools focus on trends rather than the creator.

## Solution
CreatorSpark first understands the creator by analyzing their past social media content, including captions, tone, posting patterns, and engagement. Based on this personalized context, the platform generates reel ideas, scripts, captions, and actionable insights tailored to the creator’s unique style.

## Key Features
- Social media handle–based setup (Instagram / LinkedIn)
- Personalized reel idea and script generation
- Insights explaining content performance
- AI chat assistant for post-analysis guidance

## Human-Centric Innovation
Instead of chasing virality, CreatorSpark focuses on authenticity, sustainability, and reducing creative burnout by adapting AI outputs to the creator’s identity.

## Demo Note
This repository documents the architecture and logic of a hackathon MVP prototype built using Firebase Studio for rapid prototyping and validation.
